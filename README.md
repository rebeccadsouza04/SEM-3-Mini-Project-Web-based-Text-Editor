# SEM-3-Mini-Project-Web-based-Text-Editor
The aim of this project is to create a web-based text and html editing application.
The user can manipulate the text almost as well as in a word processor, write codes in various programming languages and add the most frequently used html elements such as buttons, text areas and text fields. 
Since the document is formed the application can generate the html code for it. 
The application relies on an open source software.
The application can be used in Internet Explorer and Netscape based browsers through an automatic selection.
It has low requirements and it can be used in both old and new computer systems. 
The main difference with other editors consists to the fact that opposite to them, only pure HTML and JavaScript is being used making the code as simple as possible. 
In addition to it, “web-editor” can be easily adapted in any web-based application.

Made in collaboration with Leah D'souza, Shaun Figueiro and Collin Ferreira.
